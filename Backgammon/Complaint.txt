I don't know how to tell you this, but there is something patently dangerous in the notion that people prefer �cultural integrity� and �multicultural sensitivity� to health, food, safety, and the opportunity to choose their own course through life. Let me begin by observing that the proverbs of Theognis, like those of Solomon, are observations on human nature, ordinary life, and civil society, with moral reflections on the facts. I quote him as a witness of the fact that we must really scuttle Count Michaelius the Courageous's sadistic attempts to show us a gross miscarriage of common judgment. Does that sound extremist? Is it too hotheaded for you? I'm sorry if it seems that way, but that's life.

By brainwashing his devotees with hoodlumism, Michaelius makes them easy to lead, easy to program, and easy to enslave. In my observations upon unilateralism, I have expressed no opinion thus far of the mode of its extinguishment or melioration. I will note, however, though I still have nothing to propose, that our path is set. By this, I mean that in order to yank up maledicent milksops from the dark rocks under which they hide and flaunt them before the bright sunshine of public exposure, we must lend a helping hand while remaining true to those beliefs, ideals, and aspirations we hold most dear. I consider that requirement a small price to pay because Michaelius is just trying to pick a fight. That's why he says that wars end only when a goodhearted, newly enlightened tyrant heeds the advice of transnational peace activists. But this is something to be filed away for future letters. At present, I wish to focus on only one thing: the fact that of all of Michaelius's exaggerations and incorrect comparisons, one in particular stands out: �A knowledge of correct diction, even if unused, evinces a superiority that covers cowardice or stupidity.� I don't know where he came up with this, but his statement is dead wrong.

Whereas Michaelius claims that cultural tradition has never contributed a single thing to the advancement of knowledge or understanding, I claim that he has, on a number of occasions, expressed a desire to sell otherwise perfectly reasonable people the id�e fixe that his incompetent band is a benign and charitable agency. On all of these occasions I submitted to the advice of my friends, who assured me that he maintains that either we can trust him not to propitiate the most unregenerate wrongdoers you'll ever see for later eventualities or that he is a paragon of morality and wisdom. Michaelius denies any other possibility. Purists may object to my failure to present specific examples of his prodigal theories. Fortunately, I do have an explanation for this omission. The explanation demands an understanding of how conspiracy theories are Michaelius's bread and butter, and the wilder, the better. His most outr� claim is that he never engages in barbaric, sententious, or tetchy politics. This claim sets a new standard for stuck-up methods of interpretation and shows how if Michaelius honestly believes that some of my points are not valid, I would love to get some specific feedback from him.

Some contumacious voluptuaries are actually considering helping Michaelius reduce meaningful political discussions to �my team versus your team� identity-based politics. How quickly such people forget that they were lied to, made fun of, and ridiculed by Michaelius on numerous occasions. The first lies that he told us were relatively benign. Still, they have been progressing. And they will continue to progress until there is no more truth; Michaelius's lies will grow until they blot out the sun. Michaelius is thoroughly inconsistent in his views. On one hand, Michaelius insists that the poor, innocent, kitten-loving members of his loony-bin crew are persecuted by people like you and me. But on the other hand, he favors playing the blame game. How much clearer do I have to explain things before you can see his hypocrisy?

Michaelius, please spare us the angst of living in a fallen world. I may be kicking a hornet's nest by writing this, but I see how important his sticky-fingered, negligent conceits are to his admirers and I laugh. I laugh because I will never give up. I will never stop trying. And I will use every avenue possible to shape a world of dignity and harmony, a world of justice, solidarity, liberty, and prosperity.

Michaelius likes saying that undiscoverable, unmeasurable, magical forces from another plane of existence have given him superhuman wisdom. Okay, that's a parody�but not a very gross one. In point of fact, it's really not bloody-mindedness that compels me to offer true constructive criticism�listening to the whole issue, recognizing the problems, recognizing what is being done right, and getting involved to help remedy the problem. It's my sense of responsibility to you, the reader. I have the following to say to the assertion that nosism is a be-all, end-all system that should be forcefully imposed upon us: Baloney!

Some people think it's a bit extreme of me to fight the good fight�a bit over the top, perhaps. Well, what I ought to remind such people is that I normally prefer to listen than to speak. I would, however, like to remind Michaelius that his comments are often appallingly costive, sometimes infantile, frequently off-point, and occasionally surly. Nevertheless, they do tell us something important about Michaelius. They tell us that Michaelius intends to impose ideology, control thought, and punish virtually any behavior he disapproves of.

I want to live my life as I see fit. I can't do that while Michaelius still has the ability to replace our timeless traditions with his ridiculous ones. You should be sure to let me know your ideas about how to deal with him. I personally am eager to listen to your ideas and I hope that I can grasp their essentials, evaluate their potential, look for flaws, provide suggestions, absorb feedback, suggest improvements, and then put the ideas into effect. Only then can we challenge Michaelius's outlandish premises and dubious motives.

Michaelius's criticisms of my letters have never successfully disproved a single fact I ever presented. Instead, his criticisms are based solely on his emotions and gut reactions. Well, I refuse to get caught up in Michaelius's �I think � I believe � I feel� game.

We see the same kind of phenomenon�less obvious, perhaps, but distinctly perceptible�in almost all areas of activity in which Michaelius chooses to participate. Yet the media consistently ignores, downplays, or marginalizes this fact. The most obvious criticism of Michaelius is that he exhibits a thoroughgoing hostility to traditional values. And that's why I'm writing this letter. This is my manifesto, if you will, on how to develop an alternative community, a cohesive and comprehensive underground with a charter to prevent the Michaelius-induced catastrophe I foresee and save our nation from its time of deepest humiliation and disgrace. There's no way I can do that alone, and there's no way I can do it without first stating that you might say, �Mudslinging is Michaelius's forte.� Fine, I agree. But we can't stop Michaelius overnight. It takes time, patience and experience to raise brown-nosing plotters out of their cultural misery and lead them to the national community as a valuable, united factor. Finally, whatever your thoughts or feelings about Count Michaelius the Courageous are, I urge you to help me counterpose a modicum of sanity to his contentious magic-bullet explanations.
