Explanation for how to get reachable states this turn:


The method you want is the method called 

 GetReachableStatesThisTurn(GameBoardState state, CheckerColor color, List<int> movesLeft)

 It is static, so call it using MovesCalculator.GetReachableStatesThisTurn

 The return value is a a collection of type ReachableState. 

 In order to cast the collection to a list:

 var collection =  GetReachableStatesThisTurn(someState, someColor, someMovesLeft);
 var list = collection.ToList();

 Each of the ReachableStates have two public fields:

 - state, which is the game board state you'll use to quantify how good it is
 - movesMade, which are the moves that you used to get there
    move to the position using repeated call to the model.Move()
    The first move made is a index 0, the last one is on the highest index.
